# Spinning Donut Project

This project simulates a 3D spinning donut using ASCII characters. The donut rotates along its axes and gives the illusion of a 3D object in motion, rendered directly in the terminal.

## Features
- Real-time spinning donut animation
- ASCII-based rendering
- Smooth rotation on the X and Y axes
- Customizable parameters for rotation speed, size, and resolution

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- A terminal that supports ASCII art (e.g., Command Prompt, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.)
- Rust (latest stable version)

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/MateusZanchoNeto/donut.git
cd donut
```

## Usage
Run the project with the following command:
```
cargo run
```
Once the program starts, you should see a rotating donut rendered in your terminal. The donut will spin continuously, updating its position in real-time to create the effect of 3D motion.

## Customizing the Animation
- You can adjust the rotation speed by changing the parameters in the code (e.g., modifying the increment of the rotation angle).
- You can modify the donut's size or resolution by tweaking the ASCII rendering logic in the code.
